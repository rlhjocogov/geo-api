#summary An iPhone library for developing GeoAPI applications on the iPhone.

The Geo API for iPhone library makes it easy for developers to create iPhone applications that use local information. For example, you can request a list of restaurant names and addresses within 500 meters of a given latitude and longitude. You can also read and write custom data to a place to build your own location aware application.

= Download =

Download the iPhone SDK for XCode here:
http://geo-api.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/releases/geoapi-iphone-sdk-1.0.zip

You can also get the latest version using svn:
{{{
svn checkout http://geo-api.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/iphone-sdk geo-api-read-only
}}}

= Installation =

To use the GeoAPI library in your project, simply download the iPhone SDK package and add the
Classes/GeoAPI folder to your XCode project.  If you don't already
have the JSON library, you will also need to add Classes/JSON to your
project.  See the GeoAPIDemo project for an example of how to use the
library.

= Documentation =

You can find class documentation in the docs/ folder of the SDK package.  See
http://www.geoapi.com/ for the full API specification.
