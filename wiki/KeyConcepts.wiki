#summary Key concepts behind the MixerLabs GeoAPI: Entities and Views

*The GeoAPI exposes data in two ways: entities and views*

=Entities=

Entities are things in the world. Entities can be physical things (ex. a business, a statue or a park), as well as arbitrary demarcations (ex. a neighborhood or a school district). Each entity has:
  * name: entity name (ex. Ritual Roasters)
  * type: entity type (ex. listing). Currently supported types are listed below 
  * geom: entity geometry as a valid geojson (see [http://geojson.org/]) object. Can be a single point (a statue) or a polygon (a park). Note that a common source of confusion with geojson is that it presents coordinates in the order {{{longitude, latitude}}} (ie. compatible with the more "natural" cartesian presentation of {{{x, y}}})
  * guid: string that uniquely identifies an entity (ex. Ritual Roasters in San Francisco, CA has the ID ritual-coffee-roasters-san-francisco-ca-94110. This always means one thing, and is a permanent identifier of that business).
  * shorturl: short url at geo.am that redirects to the entity's page at http://geoapi.com/

The currently supported list of entity types are:

|| city || over 20K US cities ||
||neighborhood || US neighborhoods ||
|| business || 16+ million US businesses ||
|| POI || various points of interest such as the Golden Gate Bridge ||
|| intersections || 10+ million intersections ||


=Views=

Views are collections of data about entities. The view data associated with a specific entity can be a blob containing arbitrary data. The data within a single view should follow a consistent format (most frequently a JSON-formatted string with a predefined list of attributes). 

For a limited set of developers, we are offering the ability to have a custom writable view that allows you to associate data with entities. If you are interested in gaining access to a writable view, please [http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dGJscE5kWmc1ZjVDUzFQUW8yMmdNa0E6MA submit your information] and we'll try to accommodate your request.

The currently supported list of views are:
  * [ViewListing listing]: Listing information for business entities
  * [ViewUser userview]: Userviews that provides each api key with its own namespace
  * [ViewTwitter twitter]: Tweets in neighborhoods or close to business entities
  * [ViewFlickr flickr]: Flickr photos in city, neighborhood or close to business entities
