=Writing to a custom-writeable view=

If you have access to a custom-writeable view, you can write to it simply by POST'ing information to the view of any entity. For example, if you have a custom view called 'monsters-in-town' and you want to associate information about a monster in Ritual Roasters, you would POST to
{{{
http://api.townme.com/v1/e/ritual-coffee-roasters-san-francisco-ca-94110/view/monsters-in-town?apikey=demo
}}}
 with some data - for example:
{{{
{monsters: [
	{name: 'Zombie Fixie Rider',
	 creator: 'hipsternaut'
	 eats: ['nerds']
	}]
}
}}}
