=Writing to a custom-writeable view=

You can write data to a custom view by POST'ing information to a named view of any entity (the view is associated with your API key, and not viewable or writable with other API keys). For example, if you have a custom view called 'monsters-in-town' and you want to associate information about a monster in Ritual Roasters, you would POST to

{{{
http://api.townme.com/v1/e/ritual-coffee-roasters-san-francisco-ca-94110/userview/monsters-in-town?apikey=demo
}}}
 with some data - for example:
{{{
{monsters: [
	{name: 'Zombie Fixie Rider',
	 creator: 'hipsternaut'
	 eats: ['nerds']
	}]
}
}}}

Writing to a view overwrites its contents. You can fetch a view like any system view, the results will be returned verbatim.

The API also supports GET for writing to a view using the "set-content" parameter. Example:

{{{
http://api.townme.com/v1/e/ritual-coffee-roasters-san-francisco-ca-94110/userview/monsters-in-town?apikey=demo&set-content=I%20like%20coffee
}}}
 

==Parameters==

  * GlobalParameters
  * *set-content*: 
    * Required for writing using GET, unnecessary for POST. 
    * Description: data to write to the custom view. 
    * Format: any string.
