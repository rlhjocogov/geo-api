= Data Sources Used by TownMe =

TownMe uses a variety of data sources in this API.  Some of these sources we are required to attribute, and some we acquired a license to by paying with cash, which means we do not need to attribute them.  

We have also done some pretty heavy duty cleaning of much of the data.  This does not mean the data is by any means perfect (in fact, much of it is quite messy!)

If you see any errors, or have suggestions for good data sources to use, please contact us at "api _at_ townme _dot_ com"
