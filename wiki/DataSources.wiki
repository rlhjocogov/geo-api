= Data Sources Used by TownMe =

TownMe uses a variety of data sources in this API.  Some of these sources we have attributed below, while others we either paid for or otherwise didn't make sense for us to attribute.  

We have also done some pretty heavy duty cleaning of much of the data.  This does not mean the data is by any means perfect (in fact, much of it is still quite messy!)

If you see any errors, or have suggestions for good data sources to use, please contact us at "api _at_ townme _dot_ com"
