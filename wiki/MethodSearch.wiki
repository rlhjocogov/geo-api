#summary Search Methods

=Types of Search=

We currently support two styles of performing searches:
  * [http://code.google.com/p/geo-api/wiki/MethodSimpleSearch Simple Search]: Allows you to easily do a point/radius search for businesses and points of interest.
  * [http://code.google.com/p/geo-api/wiki/MQLSearchMethod MQL Search]: Allows you to perform more complex queries, by constraining results based on various properties, including ones in views.

*Note*: Both Simple Search and MQL search are accessed using the same url ({{{http://api.geoapi.com/v1/search}}}) - however, MQL search takes the search parameters in a single query parameter 'q' (i.e. {{{http://api.geoapi.com/v1/search?q=...}}}

==Usage Notes==

  * results are sorted by distance relative to the specified lat/lon
  * a maximum of 100 results will be returned
  * the maximum radius is 1km by default and 2km if you are searching only for points of interests.
