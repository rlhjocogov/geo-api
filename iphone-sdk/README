GeoAPI iPhone SDK

INSTALLATION:

To use the GeoAPI library in your project, simply add the
Classes/GeoAPI folder to your XCode project.  If you don't already
have the JSON library, you will also need to add Classes/JSON to your
project.  See the GeoAPIDemo project for an example of how to use the
library.

DOCUMENTATION:

You can find class documentation in the docs/ folder.  See
http://www.geoapi.com/ for the full API specification.
